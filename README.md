Basic idea is to connect patients in need to hospitals, oxygen suppliers, blood bank all at one place thereby bringing the smooth connectivity in chain. We came up with a solution consiting of three modules namely Hospital, Blood bank and Supplier, making all these data available at a single access point to the user.

<h3>Home Page:</h3>
The navigation bar enables one to register, login, look for the lastest news on covid-19 from WHO and ICMR, about button redirects to the breif infomation about our site ,which is then followed by a slidebar with qoutes from diffrent people to boost peoples' confidence and to provide lastest updates as well. The icon bar on the left redirects to respective soical media links of the government authority. The main section has three cards, one to show the registeration stats of our website, other to benificary stats, while the center card has a button for the patients,on clicking pops-up a card that takes basic infomation on requirments which then open up a search results page. Footer consits of daily cases reported in the world and India.
